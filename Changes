Revision history for CPAN-Mini-Inject

1.012 2025-04-03T04:07:45Z
	* fix a documentation nit with add() (GitHub #21)

1.011 2025-02-13T02:38:03Z
	* HTTP::Daemon and Net::EmptyPort are no longer prereqs and are
	moved to TEST_REQUIRES. If they are not present, those tests that
	use them will be skipped (#7)
	* you can now inject into an empty directory. Previously the module
	would throw an error about a missing 02packages file. Now the module
	just ignores that missing file and will recreate it. (#9)
	* document skip_cleanup and several other config values passed through
	to CPAN::Mini (#16, #17)
	* write the new 02packages data to a temp file first, then move it into
	place when it's complete. This keeps parallel processes from trying to
	edit the same file at the same time (#18)
	* error messages now include the name of the program and the names of
	any files involved. If you are testing for certain strings, you should
	check for the new strings.

1.009_01 2025-02-01T18:02:55Z
	* create 02packages as a temp file first, then move it into place.
	This is one of probably many problems with running several mcpani
	processes at the same time (#18)

1.008 2025-01-17T13:45:32Z
	* Fix indexing problem while not hiding CPAN::Meta::Convertor
	correctly.

1.007 2025-01-16T21:09:23Z

	* pass CPAN::Mini config parameters to CPAN::Mini while calling
	update (#16)

1.006_001 2025-01-15T18:43:49Z
	* pass all configuration options to CPAN::Mini->update_mirror (#16)

1.005 2024-09-09T13:18:08Z
	* temporary fix for CPAN::Meta until upstream is released. See
	https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/CPAN-Meta/issues/138 .
	(#31, from XSven).

1.004_05 2024-09-01T21:53:16Z
	* try to nail down a couple of CPAN Testers holdouts that seem to have
	weird setups

1.004_04 2024-08-18T07:16:41Z
	* if we can't start the remote server for testing, bypass the tests
	without failing.

1.004_03 2024-07-31T12:57:36Z
	* some small refactorings and doc improvements

1.004_02 2024-07-30T10:51:40Z
	* override some of CPAN::Meta::Converter so it doesn't change the
	version string. This was exposed by an edge case like v1.2.3_4 where
	the numified and string versions are different. CPAN::Mini::Inject will
	use the original string version that the distribution declared. (GitHub #11)

1.003 2024-06-10T08:56:12Z
	* left mcpani out of EXE_FILES (#3)

1.002 2024-06-07T19:31:11Z
	* promote to a user version

1.001_02 2024-05-29T00:56:52Z
	* Adjust the test for unreachable hosts when the tester resolves any host

1.001_01 2024-05-26T12:27:59Z
	* fix bug in t/update_mirror.t that caused weird issues when the
	test web server went away (AndyA/CPAN--Mini--Inject#26, from
	Lukas MÃ¤rdian)
	* added --skip_cleanup for updating a mirror (AndyA/CPAN--Mini--Inject#1,
	from Matt Lanier)
	* improved some docs (AndyA/CPAN--Mini--Inject#18, from Tim Bunce)
	* verbose now reports each time a module is injected (AndyA/CPAN--Mini--Inject#21,
	from Wolfgang Pecho)
	* repo is now https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-mini-inject . Added
	GitHub workflows too.
	* tests can now be run in parallel.

	Randy Stauner <rwstauner@cpan.org>:
	* outsource module discovery to Dist::Metadata
	* moved module discovery from script to CPAN::Mini::Inject

0.30    2011-06-13
	* keep just the last added module, even if there was one in
	02packages.details.txt before we injected
	(Paul Driver <frodwith@cpan.org>)
	* documentation fix (Randy Stauner <rwstauner@cpan.org>)

0.29    2011-05-15
	* Skip tests that are unreliable under a DNS regime where any
	hostname resolves.
	* RT 63350 - Anchor the regex to filter old modules
	* RT 55463 - Don't use .bak for test files
	* RT 63407 - Win32 fixes related to file locks in tests

	tests to fail.

	* changes for RT bug 17386 by: David Bartle

0.20    2008-06-25
	* added a command line option '--all-in-meta' which will
	parse the META.yml and index every module listed in the
	'provides' section
	* module name and version is now parsed correctly from the
	filename if relative or absolute paths are specified
	* changes for RT bug 37093 by: David Bartle

0.18.1  2008-06-25
	* Fixed bug number 28363
	http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28363

0.18    2005-04-02
	* Fixed bug number 11718 involving the Line-Count in
	02packages.details.txt.gz not being updated.
	* Added tests for update_mirror method.
	* Migrated tests to HTTP::Server::Simple.

0.16    2005-01-08
	* Decreased the size of t/read/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz reducing
	greatly the size of the package.
	* More problems discovered with exception testing. Moved all
	exception tests to a single zz.exceptions.t, skip them all
	if Test::Exception isn't installed.

0.14    2005-01-05
	* Added an optional filename parameter to parsecfg. This allows
	calling parsecfg without having to previously call loadcfg
	(tests added as required).
	* Updated Synopsis to not using method chaining, but documented
	that it is possible.
	* Updated prereq of CPAN::Mini to version 0.32
	* Fixed a warning message if dirmode isn't configured during the
	inject process.
	* Fixed update_mirror to call CPAN::Mini->update_mirror directly
	fixing a problem with CPAN::Mini::Inject and the latest version
	of CPAN::Mini (0.32).

0.12    2005-01-04
	* Tests failed for inject and add on Windows systems. These tests
	have now been skipped.
	* Reverted all tests to use eval{}. Using eval "" caused problems
	on Windows, while eval{} only caused problems on one AIX box.

0.10    2004-12-30
	* Fixed dirmode in inject(), add(), writelist(), so that all files
	created are set with the correct permissions.
	* Added tests for directory and file modes.

0.08    2004-12-08
	* Tests were found to fail on AIX which contained eval{}, all
	tests updated with eval "".
	* Added a default value for dirmode in update_mirror based on
	umask.
	* Added a dirmode option to the config file.
	* Fixed regex in mcpani to allow for developer version numbers
	with add (ie. CPAN-Mini-Inject-0.07_001).
	* Add a prereq for CPAN::Mini version 0.24. This version contains
	a bugfix to properly handle dirmode. (Thanks RJBS).

0.06    2004-11-10
	* mcpani now parses the file passed to it to determine module name
	and version. Command line options override the parsing.
	* loadcfg() croaks if no configuration file is found.

0.04    2004-11-05
	* t/readlist.t and t/writelist.t both skip failure tests if
	the uid is 0.
	* inject accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode which
	lists modules as they are injected.
	* testremote accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode
	which display the site being tested, and which is selected.
	* Added --passive switch to mcpani to enable passive ftp
	* Minor updates to perldoc in mcpani
	* Added CPAN::Mini as a required module to Makefile.PL

0.02    2004-10-31
	* First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
